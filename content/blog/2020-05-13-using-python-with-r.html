<p>In the class, we mostly used R for the majority of the semester so using Python was a little disconcerting. Luckily, the two languages can communicate with each other making the transition to Python much smoother with the familiar backdrop of R.</p>

<p>For them to talk to each other, the reticulate package is needed.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>library(reticulate)
heading&lt;-&quot;Addition&quot;
one&lt;-1
two&lt;-2
three&lt;-3</code></pre>
<p>Now we can use these in a Python code chunk in an rmd file.</p>
<pre class="python"><code>print(r.heading)</code></pre>
<pre><code>## Addition</code></pre>
<pre class="python"><code>r.one+r.two+r.three</code></pre>
<pre><code>## 6.0</code></pre>
